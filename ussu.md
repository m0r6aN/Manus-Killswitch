1.  **LLM Logic:** All agent logic (`_call_llm`, critique, refinement, proposal generation) uses placeholders. You'll need to integrate actual LLM API calls (e.g., using `openai`, `anthropic` libraries) and potentially more sophisticated state management for real debates.
2.  **ToolCore Security:** The `subprocess` execution provides basic isolation but isn't foolproof. For production, consider container-per-tool execution or more robust sandboxing. Inline Python (`function` type) was deferred due to security risks (`exec`/`eval`).
3.  **Error Handling:** Basic error handling and logging are included, but production systems require more robust strategies.
4.  **State Management (Agents):** The orchestration logic in `GrokAgent` is very basic. Real debate protocols require more complex state machines, history tracking, and deadlock detection logic.
5.  **Frontend:** The frontend is functional but basic. Features like multiple chat sessions, better tool interaction display, visualizations, and user settings need implementation.
6.  **Configuration:** API keys are currently placeholders in `config.py`. Use environment variables or a secrets management system in production.
7.  **Dependencies:** Ensure all dependencies in `requirements.txt` and `package.json` are installed.
8.  **Database Initialization:** The ToolCore database (`toolstore.db`) will be created by `init_db()` on the first run of the `tools-agent` API service (via the startup event). You'll need to register tools via the API (`POST /tools/`).
9.  **Run:** Use `docker-compose up --build -d` to build and run everything. Use `docker-compose logs -f <service_name>` to view logs. Access the frontend at `http://localhost:3000`.

Updated CodexAgent Role & Capabilities:

Workflow Generation (Natural Language): (NEW & CORE)

Accepts a natural language prompt describing a desired process or task sequence (like the email example).

Leverages its LLM backend (potentially hinting at the target_model if provided) to analyze the prompt.

Outputs a structured workflow plan as a JSON list of task objects, including:

Task breakdown (name, description).

Dependencies between tasks (dependencies list).

Execution order (execution_order).

Potential for parallel execution (can_parallelize).

Estimated complexity/duration (as best effort).

Required capabilities/types (required_capabilities, types).

Initial assignments set to null (to be filled by Grok or a planning phase).

This JSON output is designed to be consumable by orchestration logic (like Grok's state machine) and visualization tools (like React Flow).

Specification Understanding & Refinement: (As before) Analyze specs, suggest improvements, draft requirements.

Boilerplate Code Generation: (As before) Generate starter code for agents, tools, etc.

Documentation Assistance: (As before) Generate markdown, explain code.

Conceptual Q&A: (As before) Act as an internal knowledge base.

Tool Definition Assistance: (As before) Help generate JSON schemas for tool parameters.

How it would work (Workflow Generation):

Request: A Task is sent to codex_channel with intent=GENERATE_WORKFLOW. The content field contains the JSON payload: {"prompt": "...", "target_model": "..."}.

Codex Processing:

CodexAgent receives the task.

It constructs a detailed prompt for its own LLM backend. This prompt explains the goal (workflow generation), the required JSON output structure (listing all fields from your example), and includes the user's natural language prompt.

It calls its LLM.

LLM Magic: The LLM processes the request and generates the structured JSON workflow plan.

Validation: CodexAgent receives the JSON, does a basic validation (is it valid JSON? does it look like a list of tasks?).

Response: CodexAgent sends a TaskResult back to the requester (e.g., Grok) with outcome=SUCCESS and the generated workflow JSON string in the content field.

Integration with React Flow / Visualization:

The JSON output is perfect for this. A frontend component (or maybe a dedicated API endpoint) could:

Receive the workflow JSON from CodexAgent (via WebSocket broadcast).

Parse the JSON.

Transform the list of tasks and their dependencies into the node and edge data structures required by React Flow (or similar).

Render the visual workflow graph.

This visualization could then become interactive â€“ showing progress, allowing manual adjustments, etc.
