# üöÄ Manus Killswitch Combined Release Notes (Since March 28, 2025)

**Latest Release Version**: 1.1.2 (As of April 2, 2025)
**Latest Codename**: **Neural Nexus**

> *"Where agents collaborate, intelligence amplifies. The system evolves."*

## Overview

This document consolidates all major feature enhancements, architectural changes, and bug fixes implemented across the Manus Killswitch system since March 28, 2025 (post-"Quantum Maestro" release). This includes significant upgrades to core agent intelligence, collaboration protocols, the underlying backend tool execution service, frontend dashboards, and overall system integration.

## üß† Core Intelligence & Agent Collaboration

### Task Management & Execution Flow
- **Full TaskFactory Integration**: Completed integration with the reasoning effort assessment module. Task processing now considers estimated complexity.
- **Dynamic Priority Scaling**: Tasks receive priority boosts based on reasoning effort classification (LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH).
- **Comprehensive Task Tracking**: Introduced full lifecycle monitoring for tasks, including duration metrics and agent interaction logs.
- **Task Dependency Support**: Added support for sequential task chaining, enabling more complex multi-step workflows.

### Agent Framework & Logic (`base_agent.py`, `gpt_agent.py`)
- **Enhanced Agent Lifecycle**: Implemented a robust lifecycle including:
    - WebSocket bootstrap for connection initiation.
    - Real-time WebSocket listener (`_ws_listen`) for commands and updates.
    - Integrated Redis Pub/Sub (`_listen_responses`) with flexible intent handling.
    - Periodic heartbeat (`_heartbeat`) for Redis-based liveness tracking and presence.
- **Modular Intent Routing**: Agents now route actions based on specific message intents (`MessageIntent` Enum: `CHAT`, `START_TASK`, `CHECK_STATUS`, `MODIFY_TASK`) and task updates (`Task`, `TaskResult`).
- **Contextual GPT Agent Processing**:
    - Added `process_response()` logic for tailored GPT replies based on intent (e.g., playful chat, task acknowledgments, status checks restricted to 'Commander').
    - Implemented duplicate message prevention using `seen_timestamps` set (keyed by `task_id:intent`).
    - Maintains a rolling conversation history buffer (`MAX_HISTORY_SIZE`).
- **Real-time Streaming**: Agent responses are streamed back to the appropriate Redis channel and relevant WebSocket clients.
- **Fault Tolerance**: Improved Redis connection handling with automatic re-subscription on dropped connections.

### Agent Collaboration Framework
- **Structured Debate Protocol**: Implemented a multi-round agent discussion mechanism with confidence scoring to evaluate differing perspectives.
- **Arbitration System**: Introduced Claude as a mediator to resolve agent disagreements, providing reasoned synthesis and resolution pathways.

### Shared Models (`models.py`)
- **Extended Schemas**:
    - `MessageIntent` Enum updated with new intents.
    - `Task` and `TaskResult` models expanded to include fields like `confidence`, `event`, `outcome`, `contributing_agents`, etc.
- **Serialization Helpers**: Added `.to_json()` and `.from_dict()` methods to facilitate easy transport over Redis and WebSockets.
- **Schema Validation**: Agents perform internal JSON schema validation before sending messages or reacting to received data.

## üõ†Ô∏è Backend Tool Service Enhancements

*(This section details the major refactoring of the underlying service agents use to execute tools like sandbox code execution, web searches, etc.)*

- **Consolidated Service:** Merged HTTP API endpoints and Redis listener logic into a single, deployable FastAPI application for simplified deployment and resource management.
- **Redis Listener Interface:** Added a background task listening to `tool_requests` Redis channel, enabling internal agents to trigger tool executions via Pub/Sub.
- **Robust Lifecycle Management:** Implemented FastAPI's `lifespan` manager for reliable startup/shutdown of shared resources (HTTP client, Redis client) and background tasks (Sandbox Polling, Redis Listener).
- **Improved Sandbox Interaction (`ToolCoreService`):**
    - Enhanced reliability of job submission to the Python Sandbox service.
    - Robust background polling for sandbox results with configurable interval and better handling of response statuses (200, 202, 404, errors).
    - Corrected critical state management issues.
- **Refined Background Task Execution (`execute_tool_task`):**
    - Centralized tool execution logic for requests from both HTTP and Redis.
    *   **Correct Database Session Handling:** Background tasks now use a database session *factory* for per-task isolation and proper resource management.
    *   Ensured reliable dependency injection (services, clients, factories) into tasks.
- **Standardized Result Publishing:** Tool completion results (success/error) are consistently published to agent-specific Redis channels (`{agent_name}_channel`) using a standard `TOOL_COMPLETE` message format.
- **Enhanced API Endpoints:**
    *   `/execute/`, `/execute/upload-execute`: Now use `202 Accepted`, added support for sandbox `memory_limit` and `dependencies`.
    *   `/tools/list`: Correctly lists local, sandbox, and DB tools.
    *   `/execute/quick/{tool_name}`: Improved parameter handling (request body), restricted to local tools.
- **Improved Logging:** Added more detailed structured logging across the service.

## üñ•Ô∏è Frontend Improvements

### TaskDashboard Component
- **Real-time Task Visualization**: Live updates of active and completed tasks via WebSockets.
- **Effort Classification Display**: Added color-coded badges (LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH) based on reasoning effort.
- **Agent Status Integration**: Combined agent status indicators with the task monitoring view.
- **Animated Task Transitions**: Implemented smooth UI animations for task state changes (e.g., pending -> running -> complete).

### TaskFactorySettings Panel
- **Keyword Category Management**: New UI for managing keywords used by the reasoning effort classification system.
- **Threshold Configuration**: Added interactive controls for adjusting numerical thresholds for effort levels.
- **Autotune Configuration**: Provided settings interface for the classification system's self-learning feedback loop.

## üîÑ System Integration & Deployment

### WebSocket Server Enhancements
- **Task Event Broadcasting**: Real-time WebSocket updates are now sent for all task state changes throughout their lifecycle.
- **Agent Status Monitoring**: Improved agent heartbeat system tracked via WebSockets and Redis, including TTL expiration for stale agents.
- **Performance Metrics**: Added real-time transmission of task performance data to monitoring dashboards.
- **Event-Driven Loop**: The core WebSocket + Redis communication loop is now fully event-driven and intent-aware.

### Deployment & Operations
- **Full Containerization**: All system components (agents, backend service, frontend, supporting services) are now fully containerized with proper health checks defined.
- **Graceful Shutdown**: Implemented graceful shutdown and restart capabilities across services.
- **Improved Resource Pooling**: Enhanced Redis connection pooling for higher throughput and resilience.
- **Structured Logging**: Centralized logging to `/app/logs/squad.log` (within containers) with structured format for easier parsing and analysis.

## üêõ Bug Fixes

- Fixed race condition occasionally occurring in the task completion handler.
- Resolved inconsistent calculations for task priorities under certain conditions.
- Fixed a memory leak identified in the WebSocket connection manager component.
- Corrected task history retention logic to adhere strictly to defined limits.
- Resolved critical state management and concurrency bugs in the Backend Tool Service (as detailed in its enhancement section).
- Fixed issues related to `httpx` client usage and background task management in the Backend Tool Service.
